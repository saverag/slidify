## What is it

1. We want to choose car based on some insights
2. We want powerful car
3. Or economy one

--- .class #id 

## Anyway

1. We choose some preferences and get car what match
2. No boring catalogs
3. Just click and enjoy

## How it is

Actually, we use not very mindblowing technology: just select and sort based on your choice.
But this app still is quite interactive and useful in some cases. 
Mtcars dataset was used to bring this app to live.

## How it must be

Actually, if we use non-standart dataset, which contain more than 32 cars and have at least prices, this app will be much more usefull than now. It will be actually usefull. But sorry, we have it like this.
